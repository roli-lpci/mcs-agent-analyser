"""Local, deterministic static audit of the instruction assets in a bot export.

Thin adapter over `rule-audit` (https://github.com/hermes-labs-ai/rule-audit) —
the same analyzer the repo already runs as a pre-commit hook on `prompts/*.md`,
here pointed at the *analysed bot's* own instructions instead of ours.

No detection logic lives in this module. Severity, risk labels and the
pass/warn/fail mapping all come from rule-audit's published contract:

    LOW -> pass, MEDIUM -> warn, HIGH/CRITICAL -> fail (the CLI's exit-2 case)

which is `rule_audit.evidence.RISK_SEVERITY` verbatim. Inline topic prompts
are the exception: see `_inline_status`.

Scope is deliberately *instruction text* — the main agent system prompt,
connected-agent instructions, and inline `SearchAndSummarizeContent`
prompts. Tool/topic `description` and `modelDescription` fields are agent
*config* rather than instruction prose, and rule-audit is explicit that
config/tool-description linting is a different tool's job.

Everything here is offline: rule-audit is pure stdlib and makes no network
calls, so this does not move the "your data stays yours" boundary.

Disable with `MCS_DISABLE_INSTRUCTION_AUDIT=1`; uninstall by dropping the
`rule-audit` dependency (the section then degrades to a one-line note).
