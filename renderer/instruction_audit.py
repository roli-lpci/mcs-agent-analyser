"""Renders the `## Instruction Audit (static)` report section.

Presentation only — every severity, span and description below is copied
from what `rule-audit` produced in `instruction_audit.py`. Nothing here
re-derives a verdict.

Findings are split into two blocks on purpose. Contradictions, priority
ambiguities, meta-paradoxes and absoluteness challenges each point at
specific rules in the prompt and carry character spans. Coverage gaps say a
*topic is absent*, which is advisory: they fire on any short prompt and are
the main driver of rule-audit's composite risk score, so presenting them
alongside evidence-bearing findings would overstate both.
